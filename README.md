# M5Stick-CPlus2-NRF24-CC1101
This project integrates the M5Stick-C Plus2(esp32) with NRF24L01 or CC1101 transceivers:

    NRF24L01: 2.4GHz short-range, low-power RF module (SPI)

    CC1101: Sub-GHz (433/868/915 MHz) long-range transceiver (SPI)

Useful for prototyping IoT nodes, gateways, or multi-protocol communication systems.

    Dual SPI radio support on ESP32

    Wi-Fi + BLE + 2x RF links

    Ideal for sensor networks, RF bridging, remote control systems
